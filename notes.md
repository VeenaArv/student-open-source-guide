# Notes 

## Strongbox 

Strongbox had a hardware requirement of SSD, 16 GB RAM and i7 processor or the equivalent. The maintainers said that with a worse machine, build times will be very long which will
kill beginner enthusiam. I joined chat to ask maintainers questions, mistakingly glossed over specific Maven version requirement and was politely told to pay better attention to
the doc. I had thought version were minimum requirements, but some projects only support a specific version adn have not upgraded to support newer versions.

All in all, strongbox was a fail since my laptop did not meet thier hardware requirements and I need to find a different project


## XWiki 

XWiki has a quickstart VM for making one-time contributions. It has extensive docs and tags goodfirstissue. 

### Chats
I'm having trouble understanding the method of comunications. XWiki uses Riot as a bridge to IRC but apparenlty it's read only and I need to register my username to get access? 
I'll look into it later but for now, I want to see how the community communications and delegates tasks. I subscribed to the development mailing list.

### Jira 
issue tracking is done via [Jira](https://jira.xwiki.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa)
