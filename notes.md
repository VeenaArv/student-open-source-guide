# Notes 

## Strongbox 

Strongbox had a hardware requirement of SSD, 16 GB RAM and i7 processor or the equivalent. The maintainers said that with a worse machine, build times will be very long which will
kill beginner enthusiam. I joined chat to ask maintainers questions, mistakingly glossed over specific Maven version requirement and was politely told to pay better attention to
the doc. I had thought version were minimum requirements, but some projects only support a specific version adn have not upgraded to support newer versions.

All in all, strongbox was a fail since my laptop did not meet thier hardware requirements and I need to find a different project


## XWiki 

XWiki has a quickstart VM for making one-time contributions. It has extensive docs and tags goodfirstissue. 

### Chats
I'm having trouble understanding the method of comunications. XWiki uses Riot as a bridge to IRC but apparenlty it's read only and I need to register my username to get access? 
I'll look into it later but for now, I want to see how the community communications and delegates tasks. I subscribed to the development mailing list.

### Jira 
issue tracking is done via [Jira](https://jira.xwiki.org/secure/Dashboard.jspa)

## Code vs Non Code Contributions 

One of the first things I learned is that despite your technical proficiency, making non-code contributions is the best way to learn and explore an open source project. I had intially tried to start on a code issue for XWiki called "Trim Server Name Aliases" It seemed like a good easy first contribution. The difficult level was trivial and the label was onboarding. Perfect! I am onboaring. So I sent a message through Jira, the project's issue tracker, and the maintainer responded with "Please do pick it up!" So, I opened the code and was greeted by XML. Shoot. I don't know XML. It's okay, I reassured myself. I've dealt with having to write code for programming languages I haven't experienced before. So, I tried to understand the file only to realize I have no idea how web development files are stored. I have no idea where to start. Lesson #1: Pick a language/framework you are familiar with. Lesson #2: Don't code, document instead.
